This is my own, minimal linux kernel which I am actively using on ArchLinux.

The kernel config disables unneeded features, enables kernel hardening and security related features where possible, and only includes modules for my specific hardware.

It is unlikely that the resulting, built kernel image will work on your hardware - this is merely a repository to keep track of my own kernel patch as well as the Linux Kernel development as it advances.
